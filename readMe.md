# API Base URL and Test Data Usage Test Automation

Welcome to the API Base URL and Test Data Usage test automation project! This project demonstrates how to use a base URL and test data repository in REST API testing using RestAssured in Java. The code sends a GET request to a specified URL with a path parameter, validates the response, and performs assertions on the returned data using test data from a repository.

## Project Description

This code demonstrates how to use a base URL and test data repository in REST API testing using RestAssured in Java. It utilizes a base URL repository to define the base URL for the API and a test data repository to store expected data for assertions. The code sends a GET request to the specified URL with a path parameter, validates the response, and performs assertions on the returned data using test data from the repository.

## Usage

To use this code:

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including RestAssured.

2. Compile and run the `API_BaseURL_TestDataUsage` class.

3. The code sends a GET request to the specified URL with the path parameter, validates the response, and performs assertions on the returned data using test data from the repository.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following dependencies:

- **RestAssured**: A Java library that simplifies REST API testing.

To install the dependencies, you can use a build tool such as Maven or Gradle to manage them, or you can install them manually.

## Scenario

### Test Scenario

## Test Scenario: API Base URL and Test Data Usage

### Objective:
To verify that the API base URL and test data usage are correctly implemented in the test automation code.

### Preconditions:
- Ensure that the RestAssured library is properly installed and configured.
- Ensure that the base URL repository and test data repository are correctly defined.

### Test Steps:
1. **Create URL and Request Body:**
    - Define the base URL and path parameter for the API request.
    - Create the expected data for assertions.

2. **Send GET Request:**
    - Send a GET request to the specified URL with the path parameter.

3. **Validate Response:**
    - Verify that the response has the expected status code and matches the expected data.

### Expected Results:
- The GET request should be sent successfully, and the response should have the expected status code.
- The response body should match the expected data retrieved from the test data repository.

### Notes:
- Monitor the execution of the test to ensure that the base URL and test data usage are correctly implemented and that assertions are passing as expected.
- Review the console output and any log files generated by the test for debugging purposes
